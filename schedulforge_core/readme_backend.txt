📦 SchedulForge Backend (Core)

This folder contains the backend logic for the SchedulForge web application.

⚙️ Backend Overview:
- Built using **FastAPI** (Python)
- Parses complex Excel timetables with merged cells, filters by tutorial group
- Generates a structured, clean timetable dictionary
- Integrates with frontend via REST API

🔒 Important Note:
The main backend script (`main.py`) is **not included** in this public repository to protect proprietary logic and prevent code copying.

🧠 Original Logic:
The backend includes a custom-built algorithm to:
- Handle messy and non-uniform Excel structures
- Extract subjects, timings, and room numbers with precision
- Filter results based on tutorial group inputs

🚀 Access or Demo:
A working demo or backend API preview is available upon request.  
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to learn more about the implementation!
