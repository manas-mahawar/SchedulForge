## Technologies Used
**Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, openpyxl, pandas, python-multipart, pydantic  
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API, DOM manipulation)  
**Deployment & Tools:** Render, GitHub Pages, Swagger UI, Git & GitHub

## Key Features
- Detects tutorial groups and handles irregular Excel formatting.
- Processes merged cells and cleans raw data into structured JSON.
- FastAPI endpoints with live Swagger documentation.
- Light/dark mode toggle and PDF download in frontend.
- Loading spinner shows real-time processing status.

---

## How It Works
1. User uploads an Excel timetable file.
2. Backend processes file with custom logic (regex, pattern matching, merged cell handling).
3. Clean JSON is returned to frontend.
4. Frontend renders structured timetable and allows PDF export.

## Future Scope
- OCR integration to read scanned PDFs or images.
- Database storage for timetables and analytics.
- Free slot visualization and conflict detection.
- Personalized user dashboards and authentication.
- Mobile-first or PWA version.
- Extended API or migration to GraphQL.
